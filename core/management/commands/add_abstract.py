        title = "EndoVir: A Pipeline for Discovery of Novel Endogenous Viruses"
        text = "Endogenous Viral Elements (EVEs) are part of the host genome and allowhorizontal transmission within a host, but the underlying evolutionarymechanisms are still unclear. Metagenomic sequencing data sets contain a wealthof information, including sequences from viruses. Such datasets present anopportunity to analyze known EVEs and discover new ones.We introduce a new method for extending viral contiguous sequences or contigsthrough the Building Up Domains (BUD) algorithm  that identifies virus DNA fromsequencing experiments. This methodology differs from current virus discoverytools by iteratively building upon sequences that are known to contain a viralprotein domains, and searching for surrounding non-viral protein domains.We designed EndoVir to implement BUD in Python3. To reduce the use of temporaryfiles, data is streamed between processes where possible, e.g. we useMagicBLAST to screen the metagenomic datasets as it can read NCBIâ€™s SRA formatdirectly. Our implementation analyzes the results from each individual pipelinestep and allows real-time parameter adjustment. This approach allows us toadjust for the diversity present in metagenomic data sets."
